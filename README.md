# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** problems.

I try to solve each year's problem set using **different programming languages** to explore new tools, improve problem-solving skills, and understand multiple approaches to the same challenges.

### File Structure 
Each year has its own directory, and solutions inside are written in the chosen language for that year.
| Year     | 2025 | 2024 | 2023 | 2015 |
|----------|------|------|------|------|
| Language | Java  | C++  | C++  | Python |
